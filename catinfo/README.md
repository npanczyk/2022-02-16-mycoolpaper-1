# This README is all about fuzzy animals!
## This is cat info
Tabbies have stripes.
Calicos have swirls.
Tuxedos are black and white.

Did you know cats are cool? DUH.

Fun fact: there's no way to know if Schrodinger's cat had stripes or swirls.

Perhaps more pertinent- it's also impossible to know if Schrodinger's cat is dead or alive. 

## This is bunny info
Bunnies are cute and cool too! Have you seen lilR?!?!?!
